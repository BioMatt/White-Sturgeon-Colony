# Colony Pedigree Reconstruction Scripts

A repository for scripts used in pedigree reconstruction using Colony, that both simulate and analyze training data and help return Ns values for real data.
 *Note that throughout, Nb and Ns are used interchangeably. Nb refers to effective number of breeders and Ns refers to number of spawners in progeny arrays analyzed, and the technically correct term for these analyses is Ns.
